Creating a DNS server on AWS EC-2 Instance.

1. Launch a Instance on AWS using Redhat OS
2. Install bind package, command “ yum install bind -y”
3. Start and enable named service, command “ systemctl enable —now named”
4. Open named.conf file inside /etc directory, Command “ vim /etc/named.conf “
5. Clear all content of file ( :%d ) and make entry as :
        
options	{
        directory “/var/named”;
        recursion no;
};
zone “iamguru.site”	IN	{
        type master;
        file “new_dns”
};

note:- don't copy paste, write as it is

5. Check config entry with command ==> named.checkconf /etc/named.conf
       # if nothing appears , entry is correct
6. Copy file /var/named/named.empty  with preserving permissions to /var/named/  command “ cp -p /var/named/named.empty /var/named/new_dns
7. Open the copied file “new_dns” , command “ vim /var/named/new_dns ”
8. Make entry as below :- 

$TTL 1M
@       IN SOA  @ rname.invalid. (
                               0       ; serial
                               1D      ; refresh
                               1H      ; retry
                               1W      ; expire
                               3H )    ; minimum
@       IN      NS      ns1.iamguru.site.
@       IN      NS      ns2.iamguru.site.
ns1     IN      A       13.127.128.57
ns2     IN      A       13.127.128.57
iamguru.site.    IN      A       3.110.135.58
www     IN      CNAME   iamguru.site

note :- erase all and make entry accordingly

9. Make changes in child nameserver of registrar and point dns to ns1.iamguru.site , ns2.iamguru.site
10. We can check DNS is working or not by, 
                    Command  “nslookup iamgurur.site localhost”
    If we can see IP of domain then, it is correct
